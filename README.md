# Machine Learning Nanodegree with Pytorch (Udacity Course nd229)

 *Attribution Note: This repository was forked from Udacity's DSND_Term1 repository at https://github.com/udacity/DSND_Term1 *

 Content for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree curriculum, which includes project and lesson content.
 This is intended for my local completion of projects and related work, and changes will not be merged upstream. Hence working in my own repo is better than just working in the fork.
